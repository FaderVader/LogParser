# LogParser - generate Application insights

#### Project description ####

The goal of the LogParser-project is to create a python-based application that will let a user parse the log-output from many hundred instances of an certain other application and extract statistical data from these logs.

The intended users of LogParser is the team supporting the users of the target-application.

We want LogParser to generate reports that will show and highlight key performance aspects of the target-application. These data are generated by parsing several hundred log-files, generated by daily users across a large IT-centric organisation.

The reports we're looking to generate, must offer us insights into the health of the installed base of the target application. We want to present the user with relevant statistical Key Performance Indicators, that helps the user offer relevant support, and understand the current state of the target-application across all the installed instances, and the associated usage-patterns.

The target-application is a "configuration-handler" that serves as a user-facing tool to manage how to logon to a radio-production application, in a "boot-strapping" fashion.
